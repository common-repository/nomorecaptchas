Stop spam bots from registering, logging in, filling out contact forms and commenting on your site without using annoying Captcha codes or puzzles.

== Description ==


NoMoreCaptchas is enterprise-level spam protection for sites of all sizes. 

Put an end to those annoying Captcha codes that slow down or even send away your users! NoMoreCaptchas authenticates human beings and blocks bots based on the one thing that can never be faked - their behavior. Requires PHP 5.6 or higher.


= Key Features: =
* Protects registration and login pages from spam and bot attacks
* Automatic protection for login, registrations and comments
* Compatible with Buddypress, ContactForm7, Contact Form by BestWebSoft, WP-Members and Gravity Forms
* Built-in dashboard so you can see it work and keep track of who and what is trying to access your site
* Free for personal use and registered charities
* Subscriptions for businesses start at $4 per month

Developed at the University of Oxford, NoMoreCaptchas uses e-DNA (Electronically Defined Natural Attributes) to determine if a user is a human or a bot. Bots are sent away. Humans are welcomed into your site - without any puzzles, roadblocks or error-prone black lists to worry about - and without any content scanners that read your private messages before you do!

You can monitor your protection with a dashboard right on your site to keep track of who is being let in and what is being blocked. 

NoMoreCaptchas is free for personal use and for registered charities. For companies and other groups with needs beyond the personal blog or small site, we offer subscription-based services. For more information, please visit [NoMoreCaptchas.com](http://www.NoMoreCaptchas.com).

Requires PHP 5.6 or higher and WordPress 3.0 or higher.

== Installation ==

Installing NoMoreCaptchas is as simple as 1-2-3!. All you need is the plugin and a License Key. Here's how you do it:

= 1: Register =
Even if you're using NMC for free, you have to register to enjoy its protection. It takes 2 minutes - just go to [nomorecaptchas.com/#!/register](http://nomorecaptchas.com/#!/register) to receive your License Key. 

= 2: Install =
Install NoMoreCaptchas the way you would any plugin.

= 3: Validate =
By the time you've installed and activated the plugin, you'll have an email in your inbox with your License Key. Simply copy and paste that into the Settings>NoMoreCaptchas page and click on Validate. 

That's all there is to it!

Please note: We strongly recommend turning off trackbacks and pingbacks in the WordPress Discussion Settings. They are a back door for spam to exploit no matter what kind of protection you have.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which pages does NoMoreCaptchas protect? =
NoMoreCaptchas prevents spambots from registering or logging in to your site as well as commenting. And, for most contact form plugins, it protects your contact pages, too.

= What contact form plugins are you compatible with? =
You'll get the best performance with Contact Form 7, Contact Form by BestWebSoft and Gravity Form forms. NoMoreCaptchas works with other form plugins, too, but if a smaller developer makes a change, some things might get through. With these more popular plugins, though, we make sure we give you 100% protection.

= Is NoMoreCaptchas compatible with BuddyPress? =
Yes. We always test it up to the latest BuddyPress release to ensure it is compatible.

= Is the plugin really free? =
Yes. We support the product with the ad you see when you login. While in the past we had a subscription model, NoMoreCaptchas is now free for everyone.

= Do I still have to register? =
Yes. In order to ensure your site is protected, we must open access to our cloud-based service to your site. In order to do that, we need to know you want to connect to us. Please take a moment to register. It really takes just a minute or two!

= How do I set up protection for my contact forms? =
For Gravity Forms, Contact Form by BestWebSoft and Contact Form 7, it's automatic. If you use something different, please let us know and we can look into putting it in our development queue. 

= Is NoMoreCaptchas an accessible (508-compliant) solution? =
Yes! Whether you're in the US and need a solution that's compliant with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or just want to be sure your website can be used by anyone who doesn't have perfect eyesight - even the blind and visually impaired - NoMoreCaptchas will help you help your users get in the door. Others with disabilities are able to use the site without issue. Most Captcha solutions are very difficult for those with visual impairments, and the audio solutions are a clumsy workaround at best.

Since NoMoreCaptchas doesn't require users to do anything but be human, the path is made equally accessible to everyone.

= How can I tell if NoMoreCaptchas is working? =
Seeing NoMoreCaptchas in action is believing, and there's no better place to see it happen than your Dashboard, which you can find under Dashboard>Settings>NoMoreCaptchas.

= NoMoreCaptchas says I'm a bot. What can I do? =
The first thing we recommend is to use an encrypted connection to your website. Make sure it says HTTPS at the ebginning, not just HTTP (read more on the subject [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS#Difference_from_HTTP) or [here](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13266/secure-connection)). 
Alternatively, if no certificate is available for you, you can delete the cookies your website stores on your browser ([here's how to do it](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-delete-cookies/)) or you can use a different username to login.
You can also try to clear your cache. Just press CTRL and F5 together and the problem will be resolved.

= What do I need to install NoMoreCaptchas? =
Installing NoMoreCaptchas is easy. All you need are the plugin zip file and your License Key.

To get your License Key, register your site with us at [nomorecaptchas.com/#!/register](http://nomorecaptchas.com/#!/register). As soon as you do, we'll send you your license key.

Registering allows us to create a unique key for your site that will make your NoMoreCaptchas keeps spam bots away and only allows humans through the door.

= I'm still getting spam, what's happening? =
If you just installed NoMoreCaptchas, there are a few things that could be happening:
* This bit of spam was in the queue and your site pushed it live after NoMoreCaptchas was installed. Queues tend to lag up to 48 hours behind what goes live. Check your pending comments and users to make sure you don't have a queue built up.

* You may not have registered. If you believe you did (or if you're a subscriber, if know you are up to date on your payment but are not listed as active), please contact us at support@nomorecaptchas.com

* If that's not the case, then make sure your License Key was not properly entered into the control panel. Please be sure to copy and paste it directly from the email we sent you. If you no longer have your License Key, please contact us at support@nomorecaptchas.com so we can send you a new one.

= Why not just use a CAPTCHA code? =
Let's start with the reason that people hate them and then move on to the fact that people typically get them wrong. And then ask yourself, why would you ask a human to prove they're human? Shouldn't you inconvenience bots instead? 

Stanford University researchers conducted a great study on CAPTCHAs use and found that over half of all users either leave as soon as they see a Captcha-style puzzle or fail to get it right. 

We don't believe anyone can afford to send over half of their users away, so we came up with something that is simple and reliable - and does not require users to do anything but use your site.

= What makes NoMoreCaptchas different? =
Our technology was developed at the University of Oxford when our founders where there as cryptography researchers. It verifies humans and blocks bots based on user behavior. We don't use puzzles or tricks. Our method can't be hacked or spoofed. It's passive (no one needs to do anything) and always on, so you are always protected. Plus it's self-learning, so as time goes on and bots change their tactics, our technology changes to keep blocking them.

We also don't use blacklists and whitelists to cross check users. Those databases are as fallible as the humans who maintain them. They can fail to block new bots and even keep out humans whose sites or IP addresses have been taken over without them knowing it.
 
What we use is a user's e-DNA, or Electronically Defined Natural Attributes, to determine whether the user is a bot or a human. Since even the best bots only poorly mimic a few human attributes, we detect them and block them from your site. And users don't need to do anything but be themselves, so they don't slow down and your engagement goes up.

= What does your name mean? What are biochronometrics? =
Bio means life, chrono means time and metrics are measurements. So we measure life signs over time to determine whether something is a bot or human. That time usually takes about 500 milliseconds and starts while the page is loading. Humans never notice a delay and their behavior lets them in. Bots' behavior blocks them out and even the best bots cannot fake being human.

= Who shouldn't use NoMoreCaptchas? =
Spammers, scammers, bots, trolls and other Internet bottom-dwellers really should avoid NoMoreCaptchas. We're out to make their lives difficult, so they really don't like us.


== Screenshots ==
1. NoMoreCaptchas scans for human behavior while a user enters a user name and password.
2. When it recognizes a human, it welcomes them to your site - usually within just a fraction of a second.
3. You can see it in action on your Dashboard. Check who is being let in and what's being blocked - and what pages they are trying to access.
